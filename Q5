//Create a Book class with member variables id, name, author, and quantity to store
details of each issued book. The Book class should include a parameterized
constructor. Design a Library class that creates a HashMap of books, where the key is
an Integer (representing the book ID) and the value is a Book object. Instantiate at
least two Book objects and display the collection of books stored in the HashMap.
Use appropriate methods of the HashMap class to perform the following operations:
(a) Check if a particular book name is present on the map.
(b) Remove a book entry by deleting the value associated with a specific key.

        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.author = author;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }
}
